reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee### Styling a paragraph

In this example, we're using CSS to style paragraphs that have the `fancy` class set.

#### HTML

```html
<p>I'm not fancy.</p>

<p class="fancy">But I am!</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
p.fancy {
  color: red;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Styling a paragraph")}}

Only the `<p>` element with `class="fancy"` will get styled `red`.

Sometimes you just want to display the static code block that is pertinent to the example rendered within a page. However you still need HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render such an example.

To achieve this you can hide any code blocks that are not relevant with the hidden class. If you do this, omit the ### HTML/CSS/JavaScript headings for the hidden code blocks.

Using the example above but hiding the HTML code would look like this:
